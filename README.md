# ASCII (A Sophisticated Chat mark II)
This is a Hackathon project for SFU's Fallhacks 2020.

The second generations of a very sophisticated chat app. (since we're a forward looking team and we know the first gen products always suck, we decided to jump straight to Mark II)

This is a facebook messenger-like chat app but it requires user to solve ASCII puzzles in order to chat.

For testing, you can open up chrome's(or any browser's) console. We tell you the answer to the ASCII puzzles there.

## Features:
    - Online/offline status
    - Online user list
    - Message unread status
    - A list of previous chat friends
    - ASCII puzzles
